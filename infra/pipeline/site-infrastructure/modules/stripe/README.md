- **Starter Tier ($75/month)**: Ultra-affordable hosting for small applications

  - Shared hosting environment
  - 24/7 uptime monitoring
  - Low resource usage tier
  - Target: PaaS clients, prototypes, MVPs, personal projects

- **Standard Tier ($6,000/month)**: Professional DevOps for growing companies

  - 4 environments (dev/staging/qa/prod)
  - Advanced CI/CD, comprehensive monitoring

  - Pay per active server unit ($50/unit/month)
  - All DevOps features scaled to usage
  - Unlimited resource usage tier
  - Target: Businesses wanting cost proportional to resource usage

### Key Features by Tier

| Feature            | Basic      | Starter     | Standard      | Enterprise  | Usage-Based           |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Environments       | 2          | Shared      | 4             | 4+          | 4+                    |
| Support Hours      | 20/month   | Email only  | 40/month      | Unlimited   | Email (basic)         |
| Uptime SLA         | 99.5%      | 99.0%       | 99.9%         | 99.99%      | 99.9% (99.99% add-on) |
| Response Time      | <24h       | <48h        | <4h           | <15min      | Tiered by impact      |
| Monitoring         | Basic      | Uptime only | Comprehensive | 24/7        | 24/7                  |
| Infrastructure     | Shared AWS | Shared      | AWS/GCP       | Multi-cloud | Multi-cloud           |
| Max Resource Usage | Medium     | Low         | High          | Unlimited   | Unlimited             |
| Pricing Model      | Flat       | Flat        | Flat          | Flat        | Per server unit       |
| Billing Metric     | Monthly    | Monthly     | Monthly       | Monthly     | Active server units   |

### PaaS-Focused Pricing Philosophy

The DevOps pricing structure now includes multiple options to serve different customer needs:

- **Starter tier ($75/month)**: Dramatically lower barrier to entry for small applications
- **Usage-based tier ($50/server unit/month)**: Perfect for variable workloads and businesses wanting cost proportional to resource usage
- **Traditional tiers**: Flat monthly fees for predictable budgeting

**Key Benefits of Usage-Based Pricing**:

- **Fair Billing**: Pay only for the server units you actively use
- **Scalability**: Costs grow with your application, not arbitrary limits
- **Flexibility**: Perfect for seasonal businesses or variable traffic patterns
- **Transparency**: Clear per-unit pricing with no hidden fees
- **Upgrade Path**: Easy migration to flat tiers when usage stabilizes

This multi-modal pricing structure better serves both traditional enterprise clients with predictable workloads and modern PaaS customers with variable resource needs.

## Usage

### Basic Configuration

```hcl
module "stripe" {
  source = "./modules/stripe"

  domain_name = "yourapp.com"
  company_name = "Your Company"

  # Enable features
  enable_tiered_pricing = true
  enable_dynamic_pricing = true
  enable_automated_invoicing = true
}
```

### Location-Based Pricing

The module supports location-based pricing adjustments:

```hcl
# In your Rails application, use location multipliers
location_multiplier = case project.location
when 'us_west_coast' then 1.2
when 'europe' then 1.3
when 'asia' then 0.8
else 1.0
end

final_rate = base_rate * complexity_multiplier * location_multiplier
```

### Complexity Multipliers

```ruby
# In your Rails application
complexity_multiplier = case project.complexity
when 'low' then 1.0
when 'medium' then 1.25
when 'high' then 1.5
when 'enterprise' then 2.0
end
```

## Webhook Integration

The module creates webhook endpoints that listen for:

- Invoice events (created, finalized, payment succeeded/failed)
- Subscription events (created, updated, deleted)
- Customer events (created, updated)
- Product and price events

### Rails Webhook Handler Example

```ruby
# app/controllers/webhooks/stripe_controller.rb
class Webhooks::StripeController < ApplicationController
  def create
    event = Stripe::Webhook.construct_event(
      request.body.read,
      request.headers['Stripe-Signature'],
      ENV['STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET']
    )

    case event.type
    when 'invoice.payment_succeeded'
      handle_payment_success(event.data.object)
    when 'customer.subscription.updated'
      handle_subscription_update(event.data.object)
    # ... handle other events
    end

    head :ok
  end

  private

  def handle_payment_success(invoice)
    # Mark invoice as paid
    # Send confirmation email
    # Update project status
  end
end
```

## Database Models

### Recommended Rails Models

```ruby
# app/models/client.rb
class Client < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :projects
  has_many :invoices
end

# app/models/project.rb
class Project < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :client
  has_many :milestones
  has_many :invoices

  # Phase 3: Dynamic pricing fields
  # t.decimal :complexity_multiplier, default: 1.0
  # t.decimal :location_multiplier, default: 1.0
  # t.string :location
  # t.string :complexity_level
end

# app/models/milestone.rb
class Milestone < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :project
  has_many :invoice_items

  # t.string :name
  # t.text :description
  # t.decimal :amount
  # t.datetime :completed_at
end

# app/models/invoice.rb
class Invoice < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :client
  belongs_to :project
  has_many :invoice_items

  # t.string :stripe_invoice_id
  # t.string :status
  # t.datetime :paid_at
end

# app/models/invoice_item.rb
class InvoiceItem < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :invoice
  belongs_to :milestone

  # t.string :description
  # t.decimal :amount
  # t.decimal :final_rate # For dynamic pricing
end
```

## Service Classes

### StripeService Example

```ruby
# app/services/stripe_service.rb
class StripeService
  def create_payment_intent(invoice)
    Stripe::PaymentIntent.create({
      amount: (invoice.total_amount * 100).to_i, # Convert to cents
      currency: 'usd',
      customer: invoice.client.stripe_customer_id,
      metadata: {
        invoice_id: invoice.id,
        project_id: invoice.project_id
      }
    })
  end

  def create_subscription(client, price_id)
    Stripe::Subscription.create({
      customer: client.stripe_customer_id,
      items: [{ price: price_id }],
      metadata: {
        client_id: client.id
      }
    })
  end

  def calculate_dynamic_rate(base_rate, project)
    complexity_mult = project.complexity_multiplier || 1.0
    location_mult = project.location_multiplier || 1.0

    base_rate * complexity_mult * location_mult
  end
end
```

## Deployment Automation

### Cron Jobs for Automated Invoicing

```ruby
# config/schedule.rb (using whenever gem)
every :month, at: '1st day of the month at 9am' do
  runner 'Invoice.generate_monthly_invoices'
end

every :week, at: 'Monday at 9am' do
  runner 'Invoice.send_overdue_reminders'
end
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Invoice payment success rate
- Average project completion time
- Popular service tiers
- Geographic revenue distribution

## Security Considerations

1. **Webhook Verification**: Always verify Stripe webhook signatures
2. **PCI Compliance**: Use Stripe Elements for payment forms
3. **Data Encryption**: Store sensitive data encrypted at rest
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on webhook endpoints
5. **Audit Logging**: Log all billing-related actions

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1 Implementation**: Set up basic invoicing and deposit collection
2. **Phase 2 Rollout**: Launch productized services with tiered pricing
3. **Phase 3 Automation**: Implement dynamic pricing and full automation
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all payment flows
5. **Monitoring**: Set up billing analytics and alerting
