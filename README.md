# Magebase - Development Agency Quote Management System

A modern Rails 8 application with React frontend for managing project quotes, featuring AI-powered pricing, timeline generation, and comprehensive project management tools.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Interactive Quote Forms**: Dynamic feature selection with real-time cost updates
- **AI-Powered Pricing**: Intelligent project estimation using RubyLLM
- **Timeline Generation**: Visual project timelines with day-by-day deliverables
- **PDF & CSV Export**: Professional document generation for project management
- **Contract Generation**: Automated contract creation with Wyoming jurisdiction
- **Discord Integration**: Team notifications for new projects
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration for secure deposits

### Technology Stack

#### Backend

- **Rails 8.0** with Ruby 3.4.5
- **PostgreSQL** database
- **SolidCache** for caching (replaced Sidekiq)
- **RubyLLM** for AI services
- **Pundit** for authorization
- **Devise** for authentication

#### Frontend

- **React 18+** with TypeScript
- **Inertia.js** for seamless SPA experience
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Shadcn/ui** component library
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation
- **React PDF** for client-side PDF generation
- **Vite** for build system

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.4.5
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL
- Redis (for SolidCache)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd magebase/site
   ```

2. **Install Ruby dependencies**

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Database setup**

   ```bash
   bin/rails db:create
   bin/rails db:migrate
   bin/rails db:seed
   ```

5. **Start development servers**
   ```bash
   bin/dev
   ```
   This will start Rails (port 3000) and Vite (port 5173) using Overmind.

### Alternative: Run processes separately

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Rails server
bin/rails s

# Terminal 2 - Vite dev server
bin/vite dev
```

## TDD Workflow

This project follows a strict Test-Driven Development approach with these phases:

### ðŸŸ¥ RED Phase

1. **Write a failing test** for the next smallest unit of behavior
2. **Do not write any implementation code yet**
3. **Explain what the test is verifying and why**
4. **Label this step: # RED**

### ðŸŸ© GREEN Phase

1. **Implement the simplest code** to make the test pass
2. **Avoid overengineering** or anticipating future needs
3. **Confirm that all tests pass** (existing + new)
4. **Label this step: # GREEN**

### âœ… Commit Message

Always commit with a descriptive message that includes the issue number and a short description of the changes:

```
feat: implement [feature/behavior] to pass test
```

**Requirements:**

- Always commit and push on GREEN
- Always raise a PR on first commit of a new branch
- Always merge the PR into main when done and create a release when the main deployment is successful
- Include detailed comments explaining the purpose of each function, class, type, and complex logic in the code
- Always do a full PR review of your own code before merging, leave comments, and request changes if needed
- Always resolve the review comments on the PR
- Always use the MCP to link the PR to the relevant issue in the github repo
- Always resolve the linked issue after merging the PR
- Always make sure the test suite is green before making a commit
- Always make sure all workflow runs are successful before merging the PR

### ðŸ›  REFACTOR Phase

During REFACTOR, do NOT change anything besides any necessary updates to the README. Instead, help me plan to refactor my existing code to improve readability, structure, or performance.

When I am ready, proceed again to RED.

### Important Rules

- **No skipping steps** - always follow RED â†’ GREEN â†’ REFACTOR
- **No test-first = no code**
- **Only commit on clean GREEN**
- **Each loop should be tight and focused** - no solving 3 things at once
- **Use `bin/rails test` for Ruby tests**
- **Use `npm test` for frontend tests**
- **Always run full test suite before committing**

### Recent TDD Implementation

**AASM State Machine for QuoteRequest Model:**

- âœ… Added `aasm` gem to Gemfile
- âœ… Implemented state machine with states: draft, quoted, contracted, deposit_paid, in_development, completed
- âœ… Added tests for initial state and state transitions
- âœ… All tests passing
